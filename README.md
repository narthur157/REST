To run this on your machine you need to node (http://nodejs.org/) and mongo (http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) installed

Of course, you'll also need git, which if you have you can just run 
`git clone https://github.com/BostonProjectCollaboration/note-overflow.git && cd note-overflow && npm install`
which will neatly chain everything together and then stuff will be running at http://localhost:8090 or more likely everything will be broken and your computer will be raining errors. This is pre-even-having-an-alphabet-to-describe-aka-prehistoric quality software so your mileage will vary from very poor to poor
